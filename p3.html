    <p>Gaza has endured a long history of conflict, with wars and escalations shaping the lives of its people for decades. <br>Since the early 2000s, Gaza has faced repeated military assaults, each leaving behind destruction, loss, and deep psychological scars.<br> Major offensives occurred in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021, causing thousands of civilian casualties and the collapse of vital infrastructure like hospitals, schools, and homes.<br>

However, the current war—starting in late 2023—is considered the most devastating in Gaza’s modern history.<br> It has brought an unprecedented level of destruction and displacement.<br> Entire neighborhoods have been wiped out, and many families are left without shelter, clean water, or access to basic medical care.<br> The blockade has made the humanitarian situation even more dire, with food, medicine, and electricity in extremely short supply.<br>

Despite the unimaginable hardship, the people of Gaza continue to show resilience and strength.<br> They hold on to hope, culture, and community, even in the darkest times. The world watches, but the suffering continues.<br> This war is not just about politics—it’s about the lives of ordinary people caught in a cycle of violence they did not choose.</p>

<p>Before the war that began on October 7,<br> Gaza was already facing immense challenges, but life still carried on with resilience and hope.<br> Despite the blockade and economic hardship, people continued to build their lives, pursue education, and care for their families.<br> The streets were filled with children going to school, markets buzzing with local produce, and families gathering on the beach to watch the sunset.<br> Artists, students, and small business owners found ways to express themselves and contribute to their communities. Gaza’s culture, rich with music, poetry, and tradition, remained alive. Weddings, birthdays, and religious celebrations brought moments of joy in an otherwise difficult reality. Even with limited resources, the people of Gaza found ways to live, love, and dream. Life was not easy—but it was full of meaning. The spirit of Gaza, shaped by endurance and faith, shone through every aspect of daily life before the devastation of war returned.</p>

<p>After the war that began on October 7,<br> Gaza has been left in a state of deep devastation and humanitarian crisis. <br>Entire neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble, with thousands of homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship destroyed.<br> Countless families have been displaced, forced to live in overcrowded shelters or in the open without access to clean water, food, or medicine.<br> The healthcare system has collapsed under the pressure of mass casualties, and basic services like electricity and clean water are nearly nonexistent. The psychological toll on civilians—especially children—is overwhelming, with many experiencing trauma, loss, and fear on a daily basis. Life in Gaza has become a constant struggle for survival. Yet even in the face of unimaginable suffering, the people of Gaza continue to show strength, unity, and faith. Their resilience remains, but the scars of this war will stay with them for generations. The world must not look away.After the war that began on October 7, Gaza has been left in a state of deep devastation and humanitarian crisis.
